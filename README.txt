CODE TESTED ON REMOTE.CS    : YES

HOW TO RUN:
 
1) create file with name auto.py on remote.cs
2) paste the code into auto.py
3) create a file with name in.txt to store plaintext into the directory where auto.py is located

##TO ENCRYPT

1 == encryption
use your key == security
out.txt is the file which will be created 

run the following command:

python3 auto.py in.txt out.txt security 1


##TO DECRYPT

paste the ciphertext into in.txt and use 0 for decryption and key

run the following command:

python3 auto.py in.txt out.txt security 0

the out.txt will be replaced with the plaintext 



Encryption and decryption are done.
